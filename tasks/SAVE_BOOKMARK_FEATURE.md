# Save/Bookmark Feature Implementation

## Priority: High
## Status: Pending

## Objective
Implement a job bookmarking system allowing users to save jobs for later reference.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to save interesting jobs to review later
2. As a user, I want to see all my saved jobs in one place
3. As a user, I want my saved jobs to persist across sessions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Storage Implementation
- [ ] Add bookmark icon to each job card
- [ ] Implement localStorage save/retrieve logic
- [ ] Create saved jobs state management
- [ ] Add visual feedback on save/unsave

### Phase 2: Saved Jobs Page
- [ ] Create `/saved-jobs` route
- [ ] Design saved jobs listing page
- [ ] Add filters for saved jobs
- [ ] Implement bulk actions (delete multiple)

### Phase 3: UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add saved count badge in header
- [ ] Create empty state design
- [ ] Add save confirmation toast
- [ ] Implement undo functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add notes to saved jobs
- [ ] Create collections/folders
- [ ] Export saved jobs as PDF/CSV
- [ ] Add reminder notifications

## Technical Specifications

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface SavedJob {
  jobId: string;
  savedAt: Date;
  notes?: string;
  reminder?: Date;
  collection?: string;
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- Use localStorage for anonymous users
- Prepare for future Supabase integration
- Implement storage quota management
- Add data migration utilities

## UI Components Needed
- BookmarkButton component
- SavedJobsGrid component
- SavedJobsFilter component
- EmptyState component
- ExportModal component

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy load saved jobs page
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Cache saved status in memory
- Debounce save operations

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test storage limits (5MB localStorage)
- [ ] Verify cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Test data persistence
- [ ] Validate export functionality

## Success Metrics
- >30% of users save at least one job
- Average saved jobs per user: 5-10
- Return rate for saved jobs: >50%

## Estimated Time: 3-4 days
